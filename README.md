👋 Hi, my name is Shreya Balaji, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the University of California, Riverside, 
   and set to graduate in 2023. 
👀 I am interested in data science, social issues, and medicine. I hope to use my skill set to create ethical AI specifically in healthcare and for 
   social justice issues. In the future, I would like to study the long term effects of medication and diseases.
